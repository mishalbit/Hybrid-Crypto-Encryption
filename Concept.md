AES ENCRYPTION :  

To implement  AES Encryption in Java, these are the packages we use that are in the java cryptosystem. The Given below are the imported packages :-
    
            import java.security.SecureRandom;
import java.util.Base64;
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

After Importing these packages we proceed to get the input from the user using the Scanner Class present in the Java Library. Now input text will be encrypted into a secret key using  javax.crypto.KeyGenerator class where the logic has been implemented to encrypt the given input (text form) into encrypted text in the form of string. 

Post that, type casting the encrypted text into string using two string method and then capture the time-taken to encrypt the input text (in milli.secs) along with the number of characters in encrypted text. 


RSA ENCRYPTION :  

To implement  RSA Encryption in Java, these are the packages we use that are in the java cryptosystem. The Given below are the imported packages :-
    
            import java.security.KeyPair;
import java.security.KeyPairGenerator;
import java.security.PrivateKey;
import java.security.PublicKey;
import java.util.Base64;
import javax.crypto.Cipher;

After Importing these packages we proceed to get the input from the user using the Scanner Class present in Java Lib. Then A secret key has been generated by initializing the instance by 4096, we have generated the key pair which has public key and private key and based on the public key an user defined function has been written where the logic has been implemented to encrypt the given input(In our case it’s encrypt1). After a ciphertext had been generated in byte array format (byte[]) using public key  then the finalized the key has initialized to an string after it is encoded with base64 and then converted the ciphertext to encodetostring with the ciphertext byte array to get the final Encrypted Text in String Format.

MD5 ENCRYPTION :  

To implement  MD5 Encryption in Java, these are the packages we use that are in the java cryptosystem. The Given below are the imported packages :-
    
            import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.math.BigInteger;
import java.security.MessageDigest;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;

After Importing these packages we proceed to get the input from the user using the Scanner Class present in Java Lib. Then A hash text has been generated with padding ‘1’ , based on the same hashtext an user defined function has been written where the logic has been implemented to encrypt the given input(In our case it’s getmd5). After a byte hash text is generated which is the hashed text for the given input and its converted to String Format.

RSA+MD5  ENCRYPTION :  

To implement  RSA+MD5  Encryption in Java, these are the packages we use that are in the java cryptosystem. The Given below are the imported packages :-
    
            import java.security.KeyPair;
import java.security.KeyPairGenerator;
import java.security.PrivateKey;
import java.security.PublicKey;
import java.util.Base64;
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.math.BigInteger;
import java.security.MessageDigest;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;

In this approach a single input will undergo two encryption levels ,input that has been given by the user will undergo RSA Encryption and produce the RSA Encrypted text which has the length (684) then this encrypted text has been converted into String and  is given as the input for the MD5 user defined function which converts the RSA generated Encrypted text into hash text one more time with the given padding value respectively to obtain Multi-Level Encryption.

# Hybrid-Crypto-Encryption
Hybrid encryption using the symetric, asymmetric and hashing technique. Here data encryption is implemented in through java in several libraries. It encrypts the given and data and further encryption is carried for obtained public keys. It's main aspect to secure the public key during encryption. It have three steps to create the fire wall. 
AES+RSA+MD5 : here we have used different encryption to secure the plaintext and showed the function of working and time of excution through output. Here mainy hybrid encryption is implemted using the java packaging and methods. 

To implement  AES+RSA+MD5  Encryption in Java, these are the packages we use that are in the java cryptosystem. The Given below are the imported packages :-

            
 import java.security.SecureRandom;
import java.util.Base64;
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import java.security.KeyPair;
import java.security.KeyPairGenerator;
import java.security.PrivateKey;
import java.security.PublicKey;
import java.util.Base64;
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.math.BigInteger;
import java.security.MessageDigest;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;

In this approach a single input will undergo on three encryption level,input that has given by the user will undergo AES Encryption firstly and gives an encrypted text which has the length (24,44,64,....) then this encrypted text undergoes RSA Encryption and produces the RSA Encrypted text which has the length (684). After these both encryptions the latest RSA Encrypted text will be feeded as the input for the MD5 Hashing algorithm which results in a Hashed text for the RSA Encrypted Text having 32 characters, Which makes the key more robust to crack.
